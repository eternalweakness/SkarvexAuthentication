# SkarvexAuthentication 

Skarvex is a lightweight authentication system for Minecraft networks running on Velocity and Paper.

The project is split into multiple modules, such as:
- **auth-core** - contains shared business logic and interfaces
- **auth-velocity** - contains authentication proxy plugin with command and database integration (MySQL only)
- **auth-paper** - contains gameplay restrictions before authentication (world protection, lobby location, and player visibility)


## Features
- Player registration (/register)
- Player login (/login)
- BCrypt password hashing
- Session management (/logout)
- Auto-login based on trusted IP
- Login timeout protection
- IP-based brute-force protection with Caffeine Caching to reduce database load
- Password change support (/changepass)
- MySQL storage and HikariCP as a connection pooling
